# Welcome to my GitHub page!
Here are some things I've worked on for Minecraft, Just Cause 3 MP and the web.

## Just Cause 3: Multiplayer

### Justcord

Justcord links your Discord guild with your Just Cause 3 Multiplayer in-game chat! [Click here!](https://github.com/md678685/justcord-3)

### Justquery

Justcord allows you to query the status and metadata of your Just Cause 3 Multiplayer server over plain HTTP! [Click here!](https://github.com/md678685/justquery)

## Minecraft

### AdminChat

AdminChat allows you to create private chat channels on your Minecraft server for staff or other players to use. [See the source here.](https://github.com/md678685/AdminChat)

### NodeMC (discontinued)

NodeMC was a flexible wrapper for managing Minecraft servers written in Node.js with a web interface. You can see the original project [here](https://github.com/NodeMC/CORE/tree/v5-dep) or the unstable WebSocket-based fork with 2FA [here](https://github.com/N3FS/NodeMC-CORE).

## Ryver

### Unofficial Ryver Docs

The Unofficial Ryver Docs Project is an incomplete documentation of the Ryver REST API. It exists to fill in for the currently-missing official documentation, but is significantly incomplete and should be used for rough guidance only. See the latest version [here](http://ryverdocs.rtfd.io).

### node-ryver

A library never written, it was intended to be a JavaScript/Node.js library for Ryver, however the API is already accessible through the limited documentation on their support pages, the Unofficial Ryver Docs and [Hubot](https://hubot.github.com) with `hubot-ryver`.
