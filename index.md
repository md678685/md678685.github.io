# Welcome to my GitHub page!
This is my GitHub page. You can stare at my various Java projects here (and laugh at my mistakes, if you don't want to help me fix them) and see the source code for them.

## Java Projects

### BukkitPluginMD
I wrote a simple Bukkit plugin for fun. This was before the whole CraftBukkit DMCA takedown happened, and this is no longer being maintained.  
You can see the source code [here](BukkitPluginMD) in case you are interested.

### WhiteCraft
WhiteCraft is a Minecraft mod about... umm... I haven't got that far yet. You can grind stuff up and refuel stuff, though. I only work on this when I have time to, and currently I'm focusing on other projects.  
The source code is available [here](WhiteCraft).

## Javascript Projects

### TamperGrease
This is where I keep my Tampermonkey and Greasemonkey userscripts.  
You can see the scripts [here](TamperGrease)
